INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are given a dictionary after the line: QUEUE HERE.
You are also given a partially filled JSON schema after PROGRAM INFO.
The dictionary represents a queue to go through links for web crawling purposes needed to find information to completely fill the partially filled JSON schema.
Your job is to go through the the link contents (key) and the URLs (value) and remove all the links that likely wouldn't contain the needed information.
You will send the dictionary back which will be parsed into a dictionary that will represent the links that likely have information related to the program in the partially filled JSON schema.

Core rules:
- If a link looks like it points to the admissions for a university, and not the program, it can be removed.
- If a link leads to any links similar to a:
  1. Google Drive
  2. Video (Youtube, Vimeo, etc.)
  3. PDF
  4. Completely unrelated website (unless it is a Google Form)
  It can be removed.

Don't add any links and be very conservative with the link removing process. 
Don't be afraid to remove every link from the queue if it's obvious none of them are needed, in that case return an empty dictionary.
