Update program dates:
- Include term (Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall), start, and end dates only if both are clearly stated.
- Use mm-dd-yyyy format.
  - Providing only the month for dates where the days aren't given is acceptable (e.g. "September 2026")
  - If the year isn't provided, it is safe to assume that it refers to the current year

Stipend:

  - If the amount for the entire program can be calculated explicitly given the rate and amount of sessions, calculate that and return it (eg. 100 per session, 7 sessions -> 700)

Include each cost type as a separate object if multiple are mentioned.
Also keep in mind that some websites offer a variety of internships as one single internship. If multiple internships are found, assume that this is the case and have the lowest cost be the price of the internship with the lowest cost and the highest cost be the price of the internship with the highest cost.

GLOBAL RULES:
- Do NOT add or remove any keys from the schema.
- Do NOT infer, guess, or hallucinate information.
- Use "not provided" for missing text fields or categories.
- Use mm-dd-yyyy for all dates or just the year, or month and year if that is the only information given.

SECTION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. OVERVIEW:
- "title": Use the full program name only if explicitly stated.
- "provider": The organization running the program.
- "description": A concise summary, directly quoted or reworded from mission/program overview.
- "link": A direct URL to the program or application if provided.
- "subject": List stated academic topics (e.g., biology, computer science).
  - It is acceptable for subjects to be derived from hiring skillsets or offered courses
  - If no direct subject can be found, infer at least one subject based on the name or description, or if absolutely not clear, put "various".
- "tags": Use literal keywords (e.g., "free", "residential", "virtual", etc.).

Below are a list of subjects that currently exist in our database:\n"""
+str(all_subjects)+"""\n
If the program subjects fall under any of the following subjects, label it with those specific subjects instead no matter what specific wording the program uses.
For example if the program has subject "AI", since "Artifical Intelligence" is already an existent subject, label it with "Artificial Intelligence" instead.
The same goes for "Arts" and "Art". Use "Art" instead.

2. ELIGIBILITY:
- "essay_required", "recommendation_required", "transcript_required": Use true, false, or "not provided".
- "other": List any extra requirements (e.g., "An interview is required").
- "grades": Convert stated grades (e.g., 11th) into ["Junior"], and use "Rising" only if explicitly stated (e.g., "Rising Seniors").
- "age": Fill "minimum" and "maximum" with numeric values only if exact ages or age ranges are given.

Never infer age from grade or vice versa.

3. DATES:
- "deadlines": For each deadline found, fill all subfields:
  - "name" (e.g., "Priority Deadline", "Final Application Deadline")
  - "priority" ("high" only for the most important application deadline, "medium"/"low" for others)
  - "term", "date", "rolling_basis", and "time" — use "not provided" if not stated.
- "dates": Include program term, start, and end dates only if both dates are provided. Leave subfields as "not provided" if only partial data is available.
  - Providing only the month for dates where the days aren't given is acceptable (e.g. "September 2026")
  - If the year isn't provided, it is safe to assume that it refers to the current year
- "duration_weeks": Use a number only if clearly stated (e.g., "6-week program" → 6); otherwise "not provided".

Never derive exact duration from vague phrases like "a few weeks".

4. LOCATIONS:
- "virtual": Use:
  - true — if the program is explicitly online only
  - false — if explicitly in-person
  - "hybrid" — if the program combines online and in-person in one experience
  - "both available" — if users can choose between online or in-person
  - "not provided" — if unclear
- "state", "city", "address": Only fill if explicitly stated in the text.

Do not infer the location based on provider, university, or assumptions.

5. COSTS:
Each cost-related item gets its own object (never leave the costs list empty, if it explicitly says there are no costs, just put "free" as true without removing the object from the list):
- "name": Label of the cost (e.g., Tuition, Housing).
- "free": true only if clearly stated. If true, both "lowest" and "highest" must be null.
- "lowest" / "highest": Use only numeric values if explicitly stated (e.g., $2500). Else use "not provided".
- "financial_aid_available": true, false, or "not provided".

Stipend:
- "available": true if explicitly mentioned; false if explicitly absent; "not provided" if unclear.
- "amount": Use numeric value only if stated. If "available" is false, set amount to null.

Never calculate cost or stipend from scattered clues.

6. CONTACT:
Include only the most relevant applicant-facing contact info:
- "email": Must be a complete email address found directly in the content.
- "phone": Must be a valid phone number with format (e.g., 123-456-7890).
- If not explicitly present, use "not provided".

Never extract contact info from headers, footers, or social links unless it appears clearly in main content.

FINAL NOTE:
Return only the updated JSON. Never explain your reasoning. Preserve the schema structure. Only change fields if the corresponding information appears in the provided text.

For any website that is unreachable, missing, or returns a "page not found" error (or any HTTP 4xx/5xx error), treat it as an unrelated website and return: {"unrelated_website": true}.
""",

    "evaluate_links": """
You are given a dictionary after the line: QUEUE HERE.
You are also given a partially filled JSON schema after PROGRAM INFO.
The dictionary represents a queue to go through links for web crawling purposes needed to find information to completely fill the partially filled JSON schema.
Your job is to go through the the link contents (key) and the URLs (value) and remove all the links that likely wouldn't contain the needed information.

Core rules:
- If a link looks like it points to the admissions for a university, and not the program, it can be removed.
- If a link leads to any links similar to a:
  1. Google Drive
  2. Video (Youtube, Vimeo, etc.)
  3. PDF
  4. Completely unrelated website (unless it is a Google Form)
  It can be removed.
- If a website is unreachable, missing, or returns a "page not found" error, remove it from the queue.

Don't add any links and be very conservative with the link removing process. 
Don't be afraid to remove every link from the queue if it's obvious none of them are needed, in that case return an empty dictionary.
