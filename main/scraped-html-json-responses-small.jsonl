Each July, students come together to explore American history through immersive, hands-on learning experiences that take them to key historical sites. With a unique blend of classroom discussions and travel-based education, the program offers students a deeper understanding of history and its relevance to the present and future.\nSpend your summer walking in the footsteps of leaders who helped define and shape the American story, including Presidents, civil rights leaders, and soldiers who fought for the birth and survival of the nation. See and learn about seminal documents that shaped our history from subject matter experts and master teachers. Get behind-the-scenes access to historic sites no other program can provide.\nThe Academy offers a life-changing experience for high school students with an interest in the history, law and government of the United States of America\nThe Academy offers a unique blend of formal and informal learning with opportunities for first-hand experiences at the nation\u2019s premier historic landmarks in Washington, DC, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The program explores the extraordinary events and leaders of American history from pre-colonial times to the 21st century. This was the period when the idea of America took shape and when this idea survived the trauma of Civil War.\nAt the same time, the Academy will focus on major themes\u2014everyday life in the American colonies; the principles of liberty and equality embodied in America\u2019s founding documents; the divisive and decisive debate over slavery; the transformation of the national economy through the industrial and transportation revolutions; and the social and cultural impact of the struggle for civil rights.\nI loved the sites that we got to visit. The fact that everyone was from all around the country bringing different views and ideas made the experience great. I loved that my views were challenged and I got to hear the other side of the story. Having the speakers and the great people that came to see us made the whole thing that much more memorable. Bereket Hailu, Rockville, MD\nNHA\u2019s class of 2019 reflects on how the program impacted them over the course of just a few weeks.\nNational History Academy offers an inspiring and engaging learning environment. Each week, you will spend three days visiting our country\u2019s seminal historic sites and three days in the classroom delving deeply into major themes related to those site visits.\nThe Academy utilizes a hybrid of formal and informal learning methods through case discussion, debates, reading texts, watching films and documentaries, and lectures by noted scholars. You will further explore all of this through collaborative learning experiences during the immersive on-site visits.\nComprehensive Curriculum\nOur curriculum is designed to challenge you to participate and interact with your fellow students and the historical sites we visit. \u00a0The experiential curriculum is built around four components: (1) Case Method Institute history cases; (2) parliamentary debates; (3) a\u00a0speaker series\u00a0and (4) visits to the defining sites of American history.\nWatch what our students have to say about this unique learning approach\u00a0here.\nHistory CasesDebatesGuest SpeakersSite VisitsHistory Cases\nCase Method Institute Cases\nThe Academy uses the case-based\u00a0History of American Democracy\u00a0curriculum developed by Harvard Business School Professor David Moss.

This formal style of debate allows you to discuss challenging modern-day issues in contrast to the historical debates studied in the cases. You will engage in a series of debates during the summer, including self-selecting the topics, organizing your positions, and ultimately, chairing your own debates.\u00a0 Through these debates, you will be better able to understand the context of historical figures as real people struggling with difficult issues, just as you are struggling with and forming your own opinions about modern issues in the debates.\nGuest Speakers\nSpeaker Series\nNational History Academy hosts guest speakers who are nationally recognized experts in their fields as part of a speaker series. These speakers supplement the lessons learned in the classroom and during the site visits with real-world examples. Past speakers have included Civil Rights Leader Ernest Green of the Little Rock Nine, American Civil War Museum CEO Christy Coleman, Academy Award-winning actor Robert Duvall, and Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian Curator Cecile Ganteaume.\nSite Visits\nHistoric Site Visits\nNational History Academy is built around learning at many of the defining sites of American history.\u00a0 But you will not just take a tour as a member of the general public would.\u00a0 You will gain behind-the-scenes access, often visiting with the Executive Director of the site.\u00a0 On many of these visits, a scholar will talk with you and spend part of the day with us.\nHistoric site visits provide context and truly \u201cmake history come alive.\u201d Over the course of the summer, you will visit over 30 important places that help tell the American story, including Historic Jamestowne, Colonial Williamsburg, and Washington, DC; iconic National Parks such as Harpers Ferry, the Appalachian Trail, and the National Mall; the presidential homes and retreats of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Lincoln; numerous Revolutionary War and Civil War battlefields, including Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Antietam, and sites related to the fight for Civil Rights, including places that tell the stories of Frederick Douglass, John Brown, W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King, Jr . You will also have once-in-a-lifetime experiences. In 2018, Academy students saw the Broadway hit Hamilton at the Kennedy Center and screened the movie\u00a0Gettysburg\u00a0in Gettysburg with the film\u2019s director, Ron Maxwell. In 2022, students saw To Kill a Mockingbird at the Kennedy Center.\nThese immersive site visits reinforce what you will learn in the classrooms with the Harvard Business School history case studies and parliamentary debates.

This was the period when the idea of America took shape and when this idea survived the trauma of Civil War.\nAt the same time, the Academy will focus on major themes\u2014everyday life in the American colonies; the principles of liberty and equality embodied in America\u2019s founding documents; the divisive and decisive debate over slavery; the transformation of the national economy through the industrial and transportation revolutions; and the social and cultural impact of the struggle for civil rights.\nNational History Academy is built around learning at many of the defining sites of American history.\u00a0 But you will not just take a tour as a member of the general public would.\u00a0 You will gain behind-the-scenes access, often visiting with the Executive Director of the site.\u00a0 On many of these visits, a scholar will talk with you and spend part of the day with us.\nHistoric site visits provide context and truly \u201cmake history come alive.\u201d Over the course of the summer, you will visit over 30 important places that help tell the American story, including Historic Jamestowne, Colonial Williamsburg, and Washington, DC; iconic National Parks such as Harpers Ferry, the Appalachian Trail, and the National Mall; the presidential homes and retreats of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Lincoln; numerous Revolutionary War and Civil War battlefields, including Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Antietam, and sites related to the fight for Civil Rights, including places that tell the stories of Frederick Douglass, John Brown, W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King, Jr . You will also have once-in-a-lifetime experiences. In 2018, Academy students saw the Broadway hit Hamilton at the Kennedy Center and screened the movie\u00a0Gettysburg\u00a0in Gettysburg with the film\u2019s director, Ron Maxwell. In 2022, students saw To Kill a Mockingbird at the Kennedy Center.\nThese immersive site visits reinforce what you will learn in the classrooms with the Harvard Business School history case studies and parliamentary debates. The combined impact of this experiential, collaborative and participatory learning will improve your critical and creative thinking skills and prepare you for college."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"locations":{"locations":[{"virtual":false,"state":"Virginia","city":"Middleburg","address":"not provided"}]}}}]}

Visit the\u202fNIA website\u202fto learn more about employment and fellowship opportunities.\nPost Employment Opportunities\nNASA has numerous options available for utilizing the skills and experience of retirees and former employees. Employees considering retirement may prefer to stay engaged through the phased retirement program. Former employees have unique talents and knowledge highly valued by the NASA workforce. Opportunities to continue contributing to NASA\u2019s development and operations include roles such as advising, training, and mentoring\nNASA Alumni and Retiree Organizations\nFormer employees of NASA, or its predecessor, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), can stay connected and support the broad values of the nation\u2019s civil aeronautics and space programs by getting involved with the following non-profit organizations. Activities often include sharing technical expertise, educational outreach, and facilitating financial contributions to STEM organizations.\nSome individuals may qualify for membership based on NASA affiliation or a federal government detail with NASA. Alumni organizations are maintained by former NASA employees. Visit\u00a0NASA Langley\u2019s Retiree Orgs webpage\u00a0for more information and a list of center organizations.

This volunteer management portal is for those passionate about supporting causes managed by federal agencies. Use Volunteer.gov to find opportunities and apply to volunteer. This is a great resource that helps individuals give back in ways that align with their values and interests.\nContact your local NASA center to learn about\u00a0NASA STEM\u00a0volunteer opportunities and outreach activities.\nConsultants and Experts\nWhen certain knowledge and experience is needed that is not present within NASA, another federal agency, or a support contractor, NASA occasionally hires consultants and experts to complement our workforce. Agencies may appoint experts and consultants on a temporary or intermittent basis outside standard provisions related to appointments in the competitive service. Due to their decades of experience, NASA retirees are often uniquely qualified to support these needs and can share knowledge with current employees through mentoring and other engagements.\nAppointment of consultants and experts is covered under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109, Employment of experts and consultants; temporary or intermittent, and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 304.101, Expert and consultant appointments, coverage. At the discretion of the sponsoring NASA organization, some of these roles may be filled from within the U.S. as virtual roles (international access to NASA email and systems is prohibited).\nA consultant provides valuable and pertinent advice generally drawn from a high degree of broad administrative, professional, or technical knowledge or experience. When an agency requires public advisory participation, a consultant also may be a person who is affected by a particular program and can provide useful views from personal experience.\nAn expert is a person who is specially qualified by education and experience to perform difficult and challenging tasks in a particular field beyond the usual range of achievement of competent persons in that field. An expert is regarded by other persons in the field as an authority or practitioner of unusual competence and skill in a professional, scientific, technical, or other activity.\nCompensation: Consultants and experts may be appointed in a compensated or uncompensated status. Employment without compensation means unpaid service that is provided at the agency\u2019s request and is to perform duties that are unclassified. It is not volunteer service.\nType of appointment: Consultants and experts are temporary employees. Each appointment may not exceed one year and can be extended at the discretion of the sponsoring organization. An expert or consultant serving under a temporary appointment may have a full-time, part-time, seasonal, or intermittent work schedule (intermittent employment means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty).\nLength of appointment: An agency may reappoint a consultant or expert, with no limit on the number of reappointments as long as the individual is paid for no more than six months (130 days) of work or works without compensation for no more than 1,040 hours in a service year.\nThese opportunities are at the discretion of the NASA program or project sponsoring the opportunity. A supervisor must submit a Request for Services of Consultant or Expert, form NF452, to the center\u2019s human resources office then seek or identify an appropriate consultant or expert. Instructions for required documentation will be provided to the supervisor requesting the services.\nDonation of Services\nFormer NASA employees may donate their services to the agency to perform duties that are not inherently governmental and would not otherwise be fulfilled by a civil servant. Gratuitous service (donation of services) regulations allow former NASA employees to fill general advisory, non-technical outreach or education roles for the purpose of transferring knowledge.\nAnother method of donating services is to serve in an \u201cemeritus\u201d role when a NASA program or project needs a former NASA employee who possesses a high degree of technical or professional knowledge and NASA expertise for advice or opinion or for training and mentoring their successors or other members of the current workforce. Not all NASA centers offer an emeritus program.\nIndividuals interested in this option should discuss opportunities with a NASA program or project manager. Acceptance of donated services is at the discretion of NASA program or project manager and requires a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which can be obtained from the servicing human resources office.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nNot finding what you\u2019re looking for about the application process, qualifications, programs, or something else?

The aircraft will use the DyNAMITE (Day/Night Airborne Motion Imager for Terrestrial Environments) sensor system to take video mosaics of the area to assist with the emergency response effort.\nPhoto Credit: NASA/Morgan Gridley\nIn response to recent flooding near Kerrville, Texas, NASA deployed two aircraft to assist state and local authorities in ongoing recovery operations.\nThe aircraft are part of the response from NASA\u2019s Disasters Response Coordination System, which is activated to support emergency response for the flooding and is working closely with the Texas Division of Emergency Management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the humanitarian groups Save the Children and GiveDirectly.\nPersistent cloud-cover has made it difficult to obtain clear satellite imagery, so the Disasters Program coordinated with NASA\u2019s Airborne Science Program at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston to conduct a series of flights to gather observations of the impacted regions. NASA is sharing these data directly with emergency response teams to inform their search and rescue efforts and aid decision-making and resource allocation.\nThe high-altitude WB-57 aircraft operated by NASA Johnson departed from Ellington Field on July 8 to conduct aerial surveys. The aircraft is equipped with the DyNAMITE (Day/Night Airborne Motion Imager for Terrestrial Environments) sensor.\nThe DyNAMITE sensor views the Guadalupe River\u00a0 and several miles of the surrounding area, providing high-resolution imagery critical to assessing damage and supporting coordination of ground-based recovery efforts. This system enables real-time collection and analysis of data, enhancing situational awareness and accelerating emergency response times.\nIn addition, the agency\u2019s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) is flying out of NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, aboard a Gulfstream III. Managed by the agency\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the UAVSAR team is planning to collect observations over the Guadalupe, San Gabriel, and Colorado river basins Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Because UAVSAR can penetrate vegetation to spot water that optical sensors are unable to detect, the team\u2019s goal is to characterize the extent of flooding to help with understanding the amount of damage within communities.\nFlights are being coordinated with FEMA, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and local responders to ensure data is quickly delivered to those making decisions on the ground. Imagery collected will be sent to NASA\u2019s Disaster Response Coordination System.\nAdditionally, the Disasters Program, which is part of NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division, is working to produce maps and data to assess the location and severity of flooding in the region and damage to buildings and infrastructure. These data are being shared on the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal as they become available.\n-end-\nLiz Vlock/Aries KeckHeadquarters, Washington202-358-1600elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov / aries.keck@nasa.gov\nRead More\nShare\nDetails\nLast Updated\nJul 10, 2025\nRelated TermsEarthApplied Sciences ProgramEarth Science DivisionEllington FieldFloodsGeneralJet Propulsion LaboratoryJohnson Space CenterNASA AircraftNASA HeadquartersScience Mission DirectorateWB-57\nExplore More\n4 min read\nNASA\u2019s SpaceX Crew-11 to Support Health Studies for Deep Space Travel\nArticle\n5 hours ago\n2 min read\nHubble Snaps Galaxy Cluster\u2019s Portrait\nA massive, spacetime-warping cluster of galaxies is the setting of today\u2019s NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope\u2026\nArticle\n8 hours ago\n7 min read\nNASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe Snaps Closest-Ever Images to Sun\nOn its record-breaking pass by the Sun late last year, NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe captured\u2026\nArticle\n1 day ago\nKeep Exploring\nDiscover Related Topics\nMissions\nHumans in Space\nClimate Change\nSolar System\nWas this page helpful?\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nNotifications"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"unrelated_website" : true}}]}

Can I still submit my resume?\nI applied to a position, but have not heard back. How can I find out the status of my application?\nCan I make changes to an application that I submitted online?\nWhen will I found out if I was selected for the position? How long does it take?\nDo you hire people on a part-time basis?\nCan I use ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence tools to assist in drafting application and assessment responses?\nJob Seekers with Disabilities\nWhat are your current openings?\nFor a list of current openings, including Pathways opportunities, visit NASA\u2019s USAJOBS site. You can search by keyword or location. Please note that short-term, non-federal positions, such as seasonal internships and fellowships, are not listed on USAJOBS. Instead, visit intern.nasa.gov for more information on these types of opportunities.\nI don\u2019t see a current vacancy that matches my profile. Can I still submit my resume?\nNo, you can only submit a resume for a vacancy that has been advertised on USAJOBS. We do not keep resumes on file. If there are no current vacancies that match your skill set, you can create a \u201csaved search\u201d in USAJOBS to search for jobs even when you\u2019re not online. Saved searches will automatically search for jobs based on your search criteria, and email you at your primary email address when there are new jobs available. In order to create a saved search, you must first set up a USAJOBS account. Visit http://www.usajobs.gov and click on the \u201cCreate Profile\u201d button and follow the instructions to set up your account and complete your profile.\u00a0 Next, click the \u201cSaved Searches\u201d button. You can enter search criteria and begin searching.\u00a0 After you find search criteria that meets your needs, you can click on the \u201cSave this Search.\u201d Give your search a title and select a notification frequency.\nSearch examples:\nI applied to a position, but have not heard back. How can I find out the status of my application?\nYou will receive email updates from NASA on your application at key points in the process:\n1.\u00a0When we receive your application.\u00a0 You will receive an email from NASA to confirm that you have successfully applied.\u00a0 An email from USAJOBS does not confirm successful application. \u00a0Alternatively, if you successfully apply, USAJOBS will show your application status as \u2018Received\u2019. If your status is \u2018Application Status Not Available\u2019, you have not successfully applied.\n2. After an announcement closes and applications have been reviewed.\u00a0 This typically occurs up to two weeks after the announcement closes.\u00a0 You will receive an email to inform you that your resume was forwarded to a hiring manager or an email informing you of the reason your resume was not forwarded.\u00a0 If your resume was not forwarded, this will be the last email you will receive about this announcement.\n3.\u00a0If your resume was forwarded to the hiring manager, you may be contacted for a phone or in person interview as part of the selection process.\u00a0 You will receive an email after the hiring manager completes the selection process, which typically occurs within 45 to 60 days after the announcement closes.\n4. If a vacancy announcement is canceled, you will receive an email notification stating the reason for the cancellation.\nIf you have questions about the status of your application, you may reach out to the point of contact listed on the vacancy announcement.\nCan I make changes to an application that I submitted online?\nYes, you can update an application if the job has not closed and learn more here. After you review your information in USAJOBS, you will be transferred to the NASA application system.\u00a0 You will be able to view your previous answers to supplemental question and edit them if needed.\u00a0 You must follow all the steps and re-submit your application.\u00a0 After you re-submit, you will receive an email from NASA to confirm that you have successfully applied.\u00a0 An email from USAJOBS does not confirm successful application.\nWhen will I found out if I was selected for the position? How long does it take?\nYou will find out if you were selected after a hiring manager has made a decision, which typically takes between 45 and 60 days after the announcement closes, although this time frame can be shorter or longer.\nI do not have a degree, does experience count?\nIf you have experience, you may be qualified for many positions even without a college degree. Other than for professional, scientific and engineering positions, a college education generally is not required. The nature of your work experience is what really counts. Job applicants can qualify for most federal occupations based on job-related work experience and you can visit USAJobs to learn more.\nDo I have to be a U.S. citizen to apply?\nIn most cases, you must be a U.S. citizen to work for NASA. If you\u2019re not a U.S. citizen, you may wish to consider opportunities with one of our international space partners or industry partners.\nDo you hire people on a part-time basis?\nCan I use ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence tools to assist in drafting application and assessment responses?\nNASA prohibits candidates from plagiarizing any portion of their employment application to include responses to questions in which you must provide a narrative response. You must create your own responses originally and not copy or adapt them from other sources. While NASA encourages you to create your narratives with great care, including correct use of grammar and style, you are prohibited from using any artificial intelligence (AI) or AI-assisted tool, to include but not limited to ChatGPT.\u202f Any information you provide during the application process is subject to verification. NASA will discontinue your candidacy if we find you have violated this prohibition on use of AI tools in the application process.\nJob Seekers with Disabilities\nDoes a disability disqualify me for a position at NASA?\nAbsolutely not. The federal government is actively recruiting and hiring persons with disabilities. If you\u2019re an individual with a disability, you can apply and compete for any job for which you are eligible and meet the qualifications.\u00a0 You may also be eligible under a special hiring authority called Schedule A, and you can visit USAJobs to learn more.\nDo I need to disclose my disability when applying for a job?\nNo.\u00a0However, if you are applying under the Schedule A authority, we may ask you for proof of your disability before forwarding your resume to a hiring manager.\nVeterans\nWhat student programs does NASA offer?\nAt NASA, you have the opportunity to work and explore careers while still in school. The Pathways Internship Program provides current students with paid work experience and offers the chance for permanent employment at the agency. Learn more about the Pathways Program.\nIn addition, NASA\u2019s Office of Education offers internship, fellowship and scholarship opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students as well as educators. NASA internships internship generally correspond to the academic calendar and occur in the spring, summer, fall, or winter. Some opportunities are year-long, typically from August through May.\u00a0 Learn more at intern.nasa.gov.\nWhat opportunities are available for recent college graduates?\nIf you have earned a masters, doctorate or professional degree within the last two years, the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) program is an opportunity to participate in a two-year career development program with the possibility of permanent employment.\u00a0 The PMF program is announced once a year by the Office of Personnel Management.
