Each July, students come together to explore American history through immersive, hands-on learning experiences that take them to key historical sites. With a unique blend of classroom discussions and travel-based education, the program offers students a deeper understanding of history and its relevance to the present and future.\nSpend your summer walking in the footsteps of leaders who helped define and shape the American story, including Presidents, civil rights leaders, and soldiers who fought for the birth and survival of the nation. See and learn about seminal documents that shaped our history from subject matter experts and master teachers. Get behind-the-scenes access to historic sites no other program can provide.\nThe Academy offers a life-changing experience for high school students with an interest in the history, law and government of the United States of America\nThe Academy offers a unique blend of formal and informal learning with opportunities for first-hand experiences at the nation\u2019s premier historic landmarks in Washington, DC, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The program explores the extraordinary events and leaders of American history from pre-colonial times to the 21st century. This was the period when the idea of America took shape and when this idea survived the trauma of Civil War.\nAt the same time, the Academy will focus on major themes\u2014everyday life in the American colonies; the principles of liberty and equality embodied in America\u2019s founding documents; the divisive and decisive debate over slavery; the transformation of the national economy through the industrial and transportation revolutions; and the social and cultural impact of the struggle for civil rights.\nI loved the sites that we got to visit. The fact that everyone was from all around the country bringing different views and ideas made the experience great. I loved that my views were challenged and I got to hear the other side of the story. Having the speakers and the great people that came to see us made the whole thing that much more memorable. Bereket Hailu, Rockville, MD\nNHA\u2019s class of 2019 reflects on how the program impacted them over the course of just a few weeks.\nNational History Academy offers an inspiring and engaging learning environment.

You will further explore all of this through collaborative learning experiences during the immersive on-site visits.\nPrevious\nNext12345678\nComprehensive Curriculum\nOur curriculum is designed to challenge you to participate and interact with your fellow students and the historical sites we visit. \u00a0The experiential curriculum is built around four components: (1) Case Method Institute history cases; (2) parliamentary debates; (3) a\u00a0speaker series\u00a0and (4) visits to the defining sites of American history.\nWatch what our students have to say about this unique learning approach\u00a0here.\nHistory CasesDebatesGuest SpeakersSite VisitsHistory Cases\nCase Method Institute Cases\nThe Academy uses the case-based\u00a0History of American Democracy\u00a0curriculum developed by Harvard Business School Professor David Moss. This curriculum allows you\u00a0to engage more deeply with the history you are studying as you explore sites and\u00a0hear guest lectures by nationally recognized scholars.\u00a0 The cases provide an interdisciplinary and contextual examination of key historical events, permitting you to consider the multiple viewpoints of historical debates and to place yourself in the shoes of history\u2019s decision makers.\nDebates\nBraver Angels Debates\nNational History Academy partners with\u00a0Braver\u00a0Angels\u00a0on a parliamentary debate program designed to encourage civil discourse. This formal style of debate allows you to discuss challenging modern-day issues in contrast to the historical debates studied in the cases. You will engage in a series of debates during the summer, including self-selecting the topics, organizing your positions, and ultimately, chairing your own debates.\u00a0 Through these debates, you will be better able to understand the context of historical figures as real people struggling with difficult issues, just as you are struggling with and forming your own opinions about modern issues in the debates.\nGuest Speakers\nSpeaker Series\nNational History Academy hosts guest speakers who are nationally recognized experts in their fields as part of a speaker series. These speakers supplement the lessons learned in the classroom and during the site visits with real-world examples. Past speakers have included Civil Rights Leader Ernest Green of the Little Rock Nine, American Civil War Museum CEO Christy Coleman, Academy Award-winning actor Robert Duvall, and Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian Curator Cecile Ganteaume.\nSite Visits\nHistoric Site Visits\nNational History Academy is built around learning at many of the defining sites of American history.\u00a0 But you will not just take a tour as a member of the general public would.\u00a0 You will gain behind-the-scenes access, often visiting with the Executive Director of the site.\u00a0 On many of these visits, a scholar will talk with you and spend part of the day with us.\nHistoric site visits provide context and truly \u201cmake history come alive.\u201d Over the course of the summer, you will visit over 30 important places that help tell the American story, including Historic Jamestowne, Colonial Williamsburg, and Washington, DC; iconic National Parks such as Harpers Ferry, the Appalachian Trail, and the National Mall; the presidential homes and retreats of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Lincoln; numerous Revolutionary War and Civil War battlefields, including Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Antietam, and sites related to the fight for Civil Rights, including places that tell the stories of Frederick Douglass, John Brown, W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King, Jr . You will also have once-in-a-lifetime experiences.
